# What Is It Doing
This function is a way to arrange a list of numbers in order from smallest to largest. Imagine you’re sorting playing cards in your hand: you pick up one card at a time and place it in the correct position among the cards you’ve already sorted.
# Step By Step Example 
Let’s say we have this list:
Python Code
[5, 2, 9, 3]
Start with the second number (2):

Compare 2 with 5. Since 2 is smaller, swap them.
The list now looks like this: [2, 5, 9, 3].
Move to the third number (9):

Compare 9 with 5. Since 9 is bigger, no swap is needed.
The list stays: [2, 5, 9, 3].
Move to the fourth number (3):

Compare 3 with 9. Swap them: [2, 5, 3, 9].
Now compare 3 with 5. Swap them again: [2, 3, 5, 9].
3 is now in the correct spot.

The list is sorted!

Final result: [2, 3, 5, 9].

# What Does The Function Do
The function checks if two strings (a sequence of characters like words) are exactly the same, letter by letter.
# Step by Step Example
Example 1: "hello" and "hello"

Lengths are the same (5 = 5), so we move on.

Compare each character:

h = h

e = e

l = l

l = l

o = o

All match, so the function returns True.

Example 2: "hello" and "hellr"

Lengths are the same (5 = 5), so we move on.

Compare each character:

h = h

e = e

l = l

l = l

o ≠ r → Mismatch!

The function stops and returns False.

# What It Does 
This code is like opening a spreadsheet to preview the first few rows of data to understand what it looks like before analyzing or using it further.

# Key Idea 
This code ensures there are no blanks in the specified columns by filling them with the most common value. It’s like filling in blank answers on a survey with the most popular response.

# Key Idea
This code builds a "team of decision trees" that learns from existing data to predict future outcomes, just like how you might look at patterns in practice test answers to predict how someone will do on the actual test!

# What Does It Do?
It prints a message to the screen saying that a file named submission.csv has been saved.
# Why Use It?
Feedback for the User:

This is a way to inform the person running the code that a file (submission.csv) has been successfully saved.
It helps you know the program completed a task, like creating a file for submission in a competition or saving your results.

Clarifies File Name:

If you're working with multiple files, this message tells you the exact name of the file you need to look for.

# Key Idea
This line is just a confirmation or reminder that your program saved the results in a file named submission.csv. Think of it as a helpful message saying, "Your work is done and saved; here's where to find it!"

# Competition Results

This is the final step in the Spaceship Titanic, testing how well the trained model works on a set of data that wasn’t used for training. This is called validation.

This step helps you check if the model is good enough or needs improvement (e.g., tweaking settings or adding more data).
